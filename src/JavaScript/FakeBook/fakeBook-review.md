---fakeBook code review---

-classlist.add(use array for multiple classes)    //not working
-always use === if possible                       //trying
-element.style = `visibility: hidden; color: red;...`   //done
-Write less in one function                             //did as much as i could
-(AT 212) filterusers replace with const parts = parts.map(part => {users.filter()})
so it would take in account if user has more than 2 names ex. John Bae Doe
